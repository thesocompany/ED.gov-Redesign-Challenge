# Ed.gov

Hello! We are The So Company. We are a services consulting firm that provides content, usability, and software development services to government agencies and private sector organizations. Our goal is to make a lasting impact on how technology in government, health care, and other critical service areas can better serve the public and government customers alike.

The So Company Team, a SDVOSB and SBA 8(a), intends to submit a response to any solicitation related to this market research challenge. Furthermore, in a response, we intend to offer fair and reasonable prices. Based on our past performance with other similar federal agencies, we believe an offered price relating to a possible solicitation will satisfy any fair and reasonable threshold.

## Product description
To improve service to and communication with stakeholders and the general public, the Department of Education (“ED” or “Department”) plans to modernize its public-facing website. Accordingly, ED is seeking interactive prototypes for a redesign of ed.gov, the Department’s homepage.

The Department is not seeking a run-of-the-mill refresh but rather a creative redesign that maximizes user experience and proposes new innovations in layout, typography, animation, illustration, video and photography, and other modern advances.

The redesign of ed.gov should engage the American public, amplify the Secretary’s message, and advance ED’s policy goals, while maintaining high availability and high performance.
 
## Our Solution
We hypothesized that if we create a website design that is elegant and clean, with a simple and modern aesthetic that integrates human-centered design (HCD) principles, we can provide a website that maximizes user experience. We would also use new adaptations and innovations in color, layout, typography, animation, and illustration. If we also incorporate plain language content to effectively communicate with users and a modern FedRamp-approved tech stack, the website redesign can be sustainably implemented.

Requirements to complete this hypothesis include utilizing the Digital Services Playbook and USWDS design system with Department of Education branding. The So Company (TSC) followed these requirements and implemented our hypothesis. 

## Our Approach
To build the ed.gov website redesign prototype, not only did we utilize the USWDS design system, we also ran plays 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 of the Digital Services Playbook. 

(Plays 5, “Structure budgets and contracts to support delivery” is  more applicable to our government partners, so we did not address those.) Please see the Our Process section to understand more details of our process, our discoveries, and how we utilized the playbook.

*Also of note is the* [mobile version](https://xd.adobe.com/view/47f6f21b-46b8-4e52-6c67-aad1b873b1a1-31c7/?fullscreen&hints=off) *of these designs*. 

This prototype was designed in Adobe XD and deployed to an AWS site within an iframe for a more enhanced viewing experience. For more information about our tech stack and process, see the below sections. 

Because this is a prototype rather than a fully developed website, these Adobe XD designs are not mobile responsive. However, we have designed a responsive strategy, linked above. Please note that these designs do not have the same full clickable functionality as the desktop designs, as they are meant simply to serve as an example of mobile responsiveness.

### Research Plan 
We developed a research plan [(link)](https://github.com/thesocompany/ED.gov-Redesign-Challenge/blob/master/user-research/research-plan/researchPlan-06012020.pdf) that included conducting an information architecture audit, conducting three direct interviews, and creating personas and stories [(link)](https://github.com/thesocompany/ED.gov-Redesign-Challenge/blob/master/user-research/user-stories/userPersonasJourneys-06082020.pdf). We also have post-MVP research procedures if we are selected for this redesign. Our research plan indicated three essential user types for ed.gov: teachers and school staff, parents, and applying college students. Based on web search data collected from data.analytics.gov, from June 3 to June 8, we discovered top site visits for subdomains were nces.ed.gov and eric.ed.gov, and the latest CARES Act information. We used this data point  for our information architecture audit on content strategy and proceeded with directed interviews to understand the current pain points of our identified audiences. 

From our So Company research groups, we gathered three key participants for our directed interview. All signed our user consent forms for participation. The directed interview had questions aimed at:
understanding the intended objectives of our user personas with the current information on ed.gov,
